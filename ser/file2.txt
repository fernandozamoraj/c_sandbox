
Birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents,
 reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel's 
breeding colonies up to 440 kilometres (270 mi) inland in Antarctica.
The highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions. It was earlier thought
 that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics;
however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were
 offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics. Several families of birds
 have adapted to life both on the world's oceans and in them,
 with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been 
recorded diving up to 300 metres (980 ft) deep.
